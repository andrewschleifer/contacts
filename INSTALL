                  INSTALL Instructions for contacts

The utility contacts uses the universally accepted unix install idiom.
It requires the Developer Tools.  It should be as simple as running
the following commands from the contacts directory:

$ make
$ sudo make install

Why can't you just do 'sudo make install'?  Because it won't work.
When you build as root, I've found it creates problems.  So don't do
it.  Build it as yourself first with 'make', then install as root with
'sudo make install'.

And to uninstall:

$ sudo make uninstall

That's it.
